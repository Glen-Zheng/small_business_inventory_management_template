# Open-Source E-Commerce & Inventory Management Platform
*Production-ready system for small businesses and distributors*

## Project Overview

This comprehensive e-commerce and inventory management system was originally developed for and used by a fast food restaurant that scaled from a single location to international operations. After the company's acquisition and subsequent platform deprecation for newer tools, the codebase has been open-sourced to provide small businesses with enterprise-grade tools.

With real-world history backing it, this platform has supported companies that went on to expand internationally. Despite its relatively simple architecture, careful consideration was given to **security**, **scalability**, and **integration flexibility** — which contributed heavily to its success. I truly believe you can use this no matter who you are.

The platform represents proven real-history sucess handling real transactions, complex inventory workflows, and business analytics. Rather than letting this proven system disappear, we're making it available for businesses that need robust solutions without enterprise pricing.

## Why This Platform Exists

Small businesses face a critical gap: consumer-grade tools that can't scale, or enterprise solutions they can't afford. This platform bridges that divide by providing production-tested software that handles real business complexity while remaining accessible to smaller operations.

Built from actual business requirements rather than theoretical specifications, every feature addresses genuine operational challenges faced by growing companies in the food service and distribution sectors. Through extensive revision cycles, this platform has matured to account for critical production concerns including security, performance, and countless implementation details, not just a side project.
